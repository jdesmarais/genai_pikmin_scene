### Prompt

A cute, official Nintendo-style 3D scene inspired by Pikmin, rendered as a miniature diorama.

The scene takes place inside a bright bedroom, featuring a stylized wooden herringbone parquet floor.

The parquet slats are intentionally exaggerated and extremely wide, each slat as wide as ten Pikmin standing side by side, clearly breaking realistic proportions. The camera is placed low and close to the floor, making the massive width of the parquet slats dominate the foreground, strongly emphasizing the miniature diorama scale of the Pikmin.

In the left foreground of the frame, several large transparent glass blocks shaped like faceted crystal gemstones with sharp but clean edges are resting on the floor.

From the right side of the scene, one rock Pikmin are joyfully and forcefully launched mid-air toward the left, frozen at the moment of impact as they collide with the glass blocks. Two other rock Pikmin are running to the right. One rock Pikmin is rolling on the floor after the impact.

Inside the crystal-clear glass blocks, toy-like LEGO bricks are trapped and clearly visible, in bright blue, red, and yellow colors, adding playful color accents.

The impact is visible but gentle and playful: fine cracks spread across the glass surfaces, small glass shards lie on the wooden floor, and subtle debris is suspended near the collision points, suggesting motion without violence.

The rock Pikmin are cute and expressive, with rounded shapes, simple faces, and soft proportions. Some have a green leaf, others a pink bud, and a few a fully bloomed pink flower on their heads.

The scene features soft Nintendo-style lighting, clean materials, high-detail yet friendly textures, and a whimsical, polished look, staying fully consistent with the official Pikmin universe aesthetic.

### Prompt

A cute, official Nintendo-style 3D scene inspired by the Pikmin universe, rendered as a miniature diorama.

The scene takes place inside a bright bedroom, featuring a highly stylized wooden herringbone parquet floor. The parquet is intentionally exaggerated and non-realistic, with very wide wooden slats dominating the foreground. The camera is placed low and close to the floor, emphasizing the tiny scale of the Pikmin relative to the environment.

Resting on the floor is a large wooden chessboard, viewed from a slightly low angle. The chessboard squares are oversized, and wooden chess pieces are scattered across it. Some pieces are light wood (white pieces, sketched in purple) and others dark wood (black pieces, sketched in blue), with a few pieces tilted or fallen, suggesting chaos.

At the center of the chessboard stands a Shaggy Long Legs, a Pikmin boss creature (sketched in red). It resembles a giant black spider-like creature with exactly four long legs. Each leg is thin and elongated, with two visible joints, and each joint is partially hidden by small tufts of dark hair.

The four legs connect directly to a central spherical body, which is fully covered in long, shaggy black hair. The body is lifted above the chessboard, suspended by the legs, with no visible face beneath the hair.

The Shaggy Long Legs is mid-motion, appearing to walk across the board: one leg is lifted high, about to slam down and crush a chess square, while the other three legs support its weight.

Several Pikmin are actively attacking the creature. Four red Pikmin (sketched in blue) are climbing and clinging to the monster’s legs, gripping the hair and joints. Two yellow Pikmin (sketched in yellow) are leaping onto and striking the central hairy body, their movements frozen mid-action.

The Pikmin are cute and expressive, with rounded shapes and simple faces, clearly visible against the dark monster.

The scene uses soft Nintendo-style lighting, clean materials, and high-detail yet friendly textures, balancing playful charm with a sense of dynamic action, staying fully consistent with the official Pikmin universe aesthetic.
